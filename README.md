# Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes
# Overview
This project is a Spam Classifier that uses the Naive Bayes algorithm, specifically the MultinomialNB model, to classify messages as spam or not spam. The model was trained on a dataset of labeled emails, and it demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to solve real-world problems like email filtering.
